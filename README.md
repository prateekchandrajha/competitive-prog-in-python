Ultrabullet Crash Course: Competitive Programming in Python

It will run from 27th December 2020 till 31st March 2021. All Jupyter notebooks and .py files shall be shared over here periodically.

- People keep asking whether Python is the right language to choose for picking up competitive programming.

- Why not just try the most famous algorithms in Python and see for ourselves?

As CHRISTOPH DÜRR (CNRS, Sorbonne University) and JILL-JÊNN VIE (Inria) say in their book:

        You, my young friend, are going to learn to program the algorithms of this book,
        and then go on to win programming contests, sparkle during your job interviews,
        and finally roll up your sleeves, get to work, and greatly improve the gross national
        product!
